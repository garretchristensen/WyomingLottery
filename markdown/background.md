## Lottery Design

The 2026 lottery is picking 86 entrants and a 75-person waitlist from the total applicant pool.

The general goals of the lottery are as follows:

* We'd like to reward volunteers and course markers
* We value previous finishes of the race
* We'd like new entrants to have a decent chance to run within a couple-few years

So here are the activities for which we will award tickets:

* Volunteer shifts at Wyoming Range or other Freestone Endurance events
* Course marking shifts
* Previous finishes of the race


### Chosen Model

We've chosen the following weighting method:

**Tickets = 1 + 4×(Volunteer Shifts) + 6×(Course Marking Shifts) + 2×(Prior Finishes)**

Every entrant starts with 1 ticket. Additional tickets are awarded as follows:

* **Volunteer Shifts (+4 each)** = How many volunteer shifts did you complete at Wyoming Range or other sanctioned Freestone Endurance events? Approved shifts means you volunteered in an official capacity—think aid stations, course marking, etc. Informal help does not count.

* **Course Marking Shifts (+6 each)** = How many course marking shifts did you complete? These are weighted more heavily than general volunteer shifts in recognition of the specialized work involved.

* **Prior Finishes (+2 each)** = How many times have you finished the Wyoming Range race? Each finish adds 2 tickets, rewarding returning runners while still giving newer entrants a fair shot.
