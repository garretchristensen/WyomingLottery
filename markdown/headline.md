## Wyoming Range 2026 Lottery

Welcome to the (draft version) Wyoming Range 2026 Lottery. This lottery is run with code written by ultra-marathoner/economist/nerd [Garret Christensen](http://garrettheonion.blogspot.com). The code is available on GitHub [here](http://www.github.com/garretchristensen/WyomingLottery). The intent with using Github is to make the entire process transparent and reproducible. If you speak R, or want to help me improve the graphical interface, please check it out!
